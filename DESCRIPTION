Description: This package creates a game that demonstrates the Monty Hall 
              problem. A contestant is presented with 3 doors, 1 with a car and 
              2 with goats. The contestant chooses a door without knowing what 
              is behind it. The host then opens a door with a goat behind it. 
              The contestant is then given the choice to stay with their 
              initial door or choose the remiaing unopened door. If the 
              contestant's final door opens to reveal a car, they win. If the 
              contestant's final door opens to reveal a goat, they lose. The 
              montyhall package contains functions to run simulations of this 
              game in order to determine if it is a better strategy to stay 
              or to switch.
